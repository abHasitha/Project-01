                    <h1>Sun</h1>
                    <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is
                        named after the Roman god Mercurius, god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of the
                        gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as
                        Mars.</p>Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old yellow dwarf star – a hot glowing ball of hydrogen
                    and helium – at the center of our solar system. It’s about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers)
                    from Earth and it’s our solar system’s only star. Without the Sun’s energy, life as we know it could
                    not exist on our home planet. <br>

                    From our vantage point on Earth, the Sun may appear like an unchanging source of light and heat in
                    the sky. But the Sun is a dynamic star, constantly changing and sending energy out into space. The
                    science of studying the Sun and its influence throughout the solar system is called heliophysics.
                    <br><br>

                    The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. Its diameter is about 865,000 miles (1.4 million
                    kilometers). Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest
                    planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. <br><br>

                    Even though the Sun is the center of our solar system and essential to our survival, it’s only an
                    average star in terms of its size. Stars up to 100 times larger have been found. And many solar
                    systems have more than one star. By studying our Sun, scientists can better understand the workings
                    of distant stars. <br><br>

                    The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million °F (15 million °C). The
                    part of the Sun we call its surface – the photosphere – is a relatively cool 10,000 °F (5,500 °C).
                    In one of the Sun’s biggest mysteries, the Sun’s outer atmosphere, the corona, gets hotter the
                    farther it stretches from the surface. The corona reaches up to 3.5 million °F (2 million °C) –
                    much, much hotter than the photosphere.
